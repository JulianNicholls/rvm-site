[rvm1-ansible](https://github.com/rvm/rvm1-ansible) could use a little love, is
anyone up for maintaining it?

<!-- more -->

I've been maintaining this library for a few years but lately it's been neglected.

This has been due to a combination of me having not used Ansible in well over a
year and simply not having time to go through each issue and isolate all of the
problems.

It's sad to see that there's 21 open issues and 12 pull requests. RVM is a great
project and mpapis has been nothing but amazing when it came to supporting it
over the years.

I don't want to see [rvm1-ansible](https://github.com/rvm/rvm1-ansible) creep
into an unmaintained state and tarnish the RVM brand.

If you know someone who is interested in contributing to open source projects
and has a good understanding of Ansible and RVM then please contact me at
[nick.janetakis@gmail.com](mailto:nick.janetakis@gmail.com).

To everyone who is currently using the package. Thanks a lot for your feedback
and bug reports over the years and I hope you can continue using the library
with great success in the future.
